## Human Gene Atlas
This was the winning entry of the BCB BioHacks 2018 hackathon, hosted at the University of Toronto.<br/>

We developed a simple visualization of matchings of GWAS traits of genes represented in Chromosome 20, and linked them to specific parts of the body.

### Implementation
The main implementation is the visualization, which is delivered in a D3 sankey environment. The preprocessing of the data was done in Python, based on the provided files.
