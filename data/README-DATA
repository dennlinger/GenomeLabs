Dataset format and semantics
============================
The following datasets are provided:

 - Chr20GeneData.tsv    annotations for all recognized genes on Chr 20

 - Chr20GOslimData.tsv  definitions of GO terms in the GOslim subset
                        that are annotated to Chr 20 genes. The GOslim sub-
                        set is a reduced list of general GO terms that is often
                        used for a broad classification of gene function.

 - Chr20GWAStraits.tsv  Traits that have been annotated to regions spanned
                        by recognized genes on Chr 20, which were discovered
                        by GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies).

 - Chr20FuncIntx.tsv    The functional interaction network as defined by the
                        STRING database containing all high-confidence
                        edges in which both nodes are Chr 20 genes.
